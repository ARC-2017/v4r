# Contributing to V4R

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Dependencies
V4R is an open-source project with the goal to be easily installed on different platforms by providing released Debian packages for Ubuntu systems. To allow packaging the V4R library, all dependencies need to be defined in `package.xml`. The required names for specific packages can be found [here](https://github.com/strands-project/rosdistro/blob/strands-devel/rosdep/base.yaml). Packages not included in this list need to be added as [3rdparty libraries](https://rgit.acin.tuwien.ac.at/root/v4r/wikis/how-to-add-third-party-dependency) to V4R. Whenever possible, try to depend on packaged libraries. This especially applies to PCL and OpenCV. Currently this means contribute your code such that it is compatible to PCL 1.7.2 and OpenCV 2.4.9.  
Also, even though V4R stands for Vision for Robotics, our library is independent of ROS. If you need a ROS component, put your core algorithms into this V4R library and create wrapper interfaces in the seperate [v4r_ros_wrappers repository](https://github.com/strands-project/v4r_ros_wrappers).


## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker for [internal](https://rgit.acin.tuwien.ac.at/root/v4r/issues) or [STRANDS](https://github.com/strands-project/v4r/issues) are
the preferred channel for submitting [pull requests](#pull-requests) and
[bug reports](#bugs), but please respect the following
restrictions:

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Pull requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary. Therefore, this is the preferred way of pushing your changes - **do not** push your changes directly onto the master branch!
Also, keep your pull requests small and focussed on a specific issue/feature. Do not accumulate months of changes into a single pull request! Such a pull request can not be reviewed!

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

### Checklist

Please use the following checklist to make sure that your contribution is well
prepared for merging into V4R:

1. Source code adheres to the coding conventions described in [V4R Style Guide](docs/v4r_style_guide.md).
   But if you modify existing code, do not change/fix style in the lines that
   are not related to your contribution.

2. Commit history is tidy (no merge commits, commits are [squashed](http://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git)
   into logical units).

3. Each contributed file has a [license](#license) text on top.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Check if the issue has been reported** &mdash; use GitHub issue search.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test
   case.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What would you expect to
be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.
