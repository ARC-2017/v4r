%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   This document gives a specification for the paper layout for submission to the Computer Vision Winter Workshop 2015. Additionally, 
some guidelines for preparing the papers using \LaTeX\ are given. This document is written in accordance to the specification and guidelines, 
and hence may be used as an example of how a paper should look like. 
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT

\section{Introduction}

Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.
Authors will be given an opportunity to withdraw
their paper from the proceedings so that no
restrictions on submitting the work to other conferences
and journals is imposed. If the paper is published
in the workshop proceedings, it will also be
available for download on our webpage.


\subsection{Language}
All manuscripts must be written in English. 

\subsection{Paper length}
The paper must not be longer than 8 pages including all figures and references. Pages beyond the eighth will be cut.

\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review. The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution. The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (Users should uncomment
the \verb'\cvwwfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.) 

\subsection{Page numbers}
There should be no page numbering in the parts of the paper that will
appear in the Proceedings, page numbers will be added by the editor.

\subsection{Equations}
Equations should be centered and numbered like this:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_n(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1} \exp(-t) dt.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
Figures (such as Fig.~\ref{fig:total}) and tables (such as Tab.~\ref{tab:detail})
should be numbered separately within the page\footnote{Example footnote.}.  All
figures and tables must be given a caption, which should appear below
the display. Captions should be centered below the display.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\columnwidth]{picture.pdf}
    \caption{Example Figure.}
    \label{fig:total}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l | c c c | c}
        What      & Column1 & Column2 & Colum3 & Total\\ \hline\hline
      Row1        &  1  & 2     & 3 & 6 \\
      Row2 &   4  & 5     & 6 & 15 \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Example Table.}
  \label{tab:detail}
\end{table}

Example of a reference ~\cite{Authors06}.
\subsection{Color}
Color is valuable, and will be visible to readers of the electronic copy. However ensure that, when printed on a monochrome printer, no important information is lost by conversion to gray scale.

\section{Submission Details}
Your paper should be submitted using the CVWW 2015 submission system which will be accessible via the CVWW 2015 webpage at
